description: In February 2020, Google released Android Studio version 3.6. This update introduced several new features, including Google Maps for the Emulator and Split View, which allows us to preview our design changes without needing to install the app on an emulator or real device. Split View also enables us to design pages by dragging and dropping available components directly onto the XML file in the res/layout folder.
