description:
  ViewModel is one of the components of Android Jetpack introduced by the Android Framework team at Google I/O 2017. The main function of the ViewModel is to handle configuration changes that can cause Activity or Fragment to repeat the onCreate function call, resulting in the data in the Activity or Fragment being lost and re-initiated.
