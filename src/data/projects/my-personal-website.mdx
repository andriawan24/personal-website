description:
  This is the website you're currently viewing. I've been experimenting a lot with it, and I feel incredibly excited to explore things beyond my daily work. This is why I decided to create this personal website.
  As an Android engineer, I usually focus on mobile development, but building this website allows me to dive into different areas of technology and creativity. It's a way for me to grow, learn new skills, and showcase my work in a broader context.
